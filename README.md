## Information

This is a Event Planner to manage the Institute's volunteers who want to help at
the application of the games in schools. The necessity of this planner comes
from the rising number of people wanting to help.

In the actual scenario, people will send a message to the Institute every time
a event is schedule and the Institute will select this volunteers by the order
of registration. That has became a problem because some people are always
selected and other never get a chance to participate.

## Technologies

- NodeJS at the backend
- ReactJS at the frontend
- React Native for the mobile
- Using Azure Functions as the backend
- Using Azure Table Storage to handle the data

## Features

Some features that the Event Planner needs are:

- Registration page for volunteers
- Event creation page for Event Managers
- A system that select the volunteers
- Confirmation page for volunteers

## Deliverable

The hope for this project is to deliver a Web Application to control this Event
Planner. The Web Application will use NodeJS at the backend and React at the
Front.
